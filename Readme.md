The .py files in this MSCS532_Project folder includes the implementation of an inverted index (invertedIndex.py), a trie (trie.py), a heap (heap.py) and a graph (graph.py).

File Breakdown:
invertedIndex.py: Contains the class InvertedIndex for creating and managing the inverted index.
trie.py: Contains the class Trie for implementing a trie data structure for query auto-completion.
heap.py: Contains the class Top Heap for ranking search results using a heap.
main.py: The main script to demonstrate the functionality of all data structures.
test.py: A separate test script with unit tests to validate the core functionality of the data structures.

Instruction:
Run main.py to see a demonstration of the data structures.
Run test.py to execute the test cases.

#Recent Commit contains updated invertedIndex.py, trie.py, heap.py and test.py files to handle larger datasets.
